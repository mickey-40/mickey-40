### Hi there 👋

<!--
**mickey-40/mickey-40** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.


- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript

- 😎 I am an aspiring software engineer who is currently completing a coding boot camp through General Assembly.  Technology is something that seems to come naturally to me. I love to problem-solve and coding gives me that opportunity. First, as a soldier, I learned to work with a team of people to complete objectives. Then, as an electrician, I also learned how to troubleshoot problems and run job sites independently. Currently, as a math teacher, I have designed data-driven lessons. I am the team lead for my grade level. I also have to differentiate lessons to meet the student's individual needs. I have also been a part of the designing of a grade-level interdisciplinary project. My students achieved state test scores of over 90%. I have made connections with my students, their parents and my teacher colleagues to complete grade-level objectives. I am excited to utilize all my skills in this new field.
